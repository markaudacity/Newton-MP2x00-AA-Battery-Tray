# Newton MP2x00 AA Battery Tray

## About
Many users of MessagePad 2000 and 2100s have a very small selection of vendors selling official AA battery trays.  The intent of this project is to bring a low-cost, 3D-printable version of the scarce part.

## Usage
The 3D models in this package are in Autodesk Inventor 2011 and industry-standard STL file formats.

These files can be printed with (mostly) any rapid prototype machine/3D printer. Follow the instructions included with your printer for uploading the 3D models.

## Tips for printing

- Printing this part radially (instead of axially) can dramatically improve the part's quality. When printed axially, the outer dimensions are slightly off, and very jagged.

- Using a printer that can print with a 0.2mm resolution will greatly improve the fit.
